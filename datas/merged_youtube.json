We need to protect our environment and we have all its companies under the Food and Beverage umbrella. We have a lot of plants, a lot of holistic plants. One of the plants is related to packaging, the having sustainable packaging. We have a lot of challenges when it comes to sustainable packaging, where we have new ingredients, we have new contents of recycled material. What we see is that our government here still we need to have more food safety studies and we need to rely as well on some of the references globally. So the challenges are really more than what we can expect in general, but we are now collaborating with the government entities to try to develop the right standards and regulation to ensure the safety of the food under the recycled content. However, it is a journey and we are collaborating with the Ministry of Industry to try to find the opportunity to work on the draft regulation and then have it approved. But also the harmonization with the GCC is very important to ensure that we have the right trade and we don't have any challenges when it comes to having the products in all the markets at the same level because safety is the most important aspect for all the Gulf food strategies. So we aim to have this under the future food event to discuss all the opportunities and the new innovation and we aim as well to collaborate with the government entities more and more to develop the right regulation which ensure the sustainability targets with MOCA and as well to ensure the safety for the consumers.

For the Innovation Lab, basically this is the second year in a row that Emerson Macaroni participated with Challenges and we were as said previously very lucky that the previous year one of our candidates won the award. We hope for this year as well with the challenges that we chose and one of them is the waste management sustainability that the two teams that we have aspire and mastermind that one of them could actually pick up the prize and win. The challenge is really interesting it's a by-product it's basically using the waste coming out of the pasta, the regrinded pasta and transform them and mix them with other materials. One is to become as a product for animal feed and the other one is for fertilizer. Emerson Macaroni is happy to be part of the Innovation Lab which is supported by the FMB group and Khalifa fund and this is a major initiative to develop and drive the youth of the UAE to go into the food sector. The amount of seriousness to be quite honest how they took this challenge and you know not every idea or every challenge you start from the beginning and you just like reach till the end with the same direction there are some deviations that they've took in order to fix the challenge and get it towards the end. Actually Emerson Macaroni factory support started since the beginning and by the beginning I mean the idea brainstorming. We would come up and talk with Mr. Sammi about our ideas and what we are looking forward to do together and that went out to be where we are now. Coming to the new fishenotors was one of the main challenges we faced because we need to know what the product itself contains so though it took a lot of time but we were able to come up with the right information of what what all stuff the product contains and by knowing that we were able to incorporate the other essential nutrients to our feeder. Of course this could not have been easier or this could not have happened without the help of Emerson Macaroni factory thanks to the team who was always there in our back they had I can hold you and I'm there for you mentality where they served us. Hi my name is Mohamed Serlas Shrubf I'm a master student in food science from your university. I came to know about this FNB innovation program from our college from our professors and the University members. We joined the FNB innovation program to know about more about the challenges and the manufacturers. We were teamed up we met the other team members Karima Sheha and Ali from the Innovation Ideatone Week. From though we grew up together and we started doing the challenges together and finally we were able to be selected for the Emerson Macaroni Challenge. So right from the beginning when we came across the Emerson Macaroni Challenge we were interested to participate for that since they were dealing with the waste management and how they could solve their past service teaching their company. So we came up with suitable solution how we could come up with a new product which is sustainable and feasible. I'm Karima Fadi I'm a graduate student at your university I'm taking my masters in food science. I got to know about FNB through university thanks to my doctors and through there I only got to meet my team members and we got to have an aspire team. Personally my interest in waste management and sustainability as well as poultry of course has sparked the interest of Emirates Macaroni factory. Basically the idea of getting the waste past a meal and putting it in the feed production has been always an idea that triggered me and with this collaboration as well as my team having an interest in that we got to work and produce a new feed where it's sustainable. It's part of it is from food wastage as well as part of it has been locally produced since the pasta and Emirates Macaroni factory is locally produced.",

Thank you for providing this home material from UN to us and also thank you for the idea. Inside my mind and heart I had a thought one day we had to make something for Emirates. I came 1985 to this country so I need to do something before I leave this country that thought was there. The moment I met you through Prapati and the FNB team. I was so happy to get this idea on board with Barakkar. The raw material came to us so we started developing products. One we have already here which is Gaf Leaves now. We are going to blend this Gaf Leaves with banana and local dates and the camel milk and pure honey. The product is sugar free and product is having a lot of health benefits which you already did to your studies and home work. So we like to do this trial now to show you how we make the Gaf Smooth. So in order to develop any food product is required a lot of stuff starting from growing ingredients, availability, testing and studies and label regulations as well. So I was proud enough to have some mentors that can guide me through this journey to achieve all of these steps in order to launch the product. So I'm happy to know that this product will be launched soon in the market. I am happy to be selected as a part of the Innovation Lab and I would like to thank Halifa Fund, FNB Groups and Barakkar for making my dreams come true. Innovation for us is a way of life, one of the strongest pillar of what Barakkar stands for. This has been the second year Barakkar has been taking part in the Innovation Lab program. Thank you very much to the FNB team and the Khalifa Fund for giving us this opportunity. It's just not been a learning curve for us as manufacturers but a great opportunity for the young talents. Together with the young Emirates I think it's been a long journey from the starting stage to the boot camp program and the last but not the least the Dragon stand. This year there have been very innovative and a lot of challenging topics. There were a lot of people who had competent and taken up Barakkar's challenge. One of Barakkar's challenge was to create a product which was made from a superfood which contributes towards the health and wellness of people. What better challenge can we think of in today's world after the pandemic? We've had a lot of competitors taking up the challenge. It has been a great learning experience for us as well as for the students. The competition was not easy enough. It was a tough competition. At the end we've had two students who we had shortlisted, one for which we have been working very closely for an internship program. But together as a product which we got out from a very small budding stage into reality has been a new product which you will be seeing out soon. I wish good luck to Salma who has been working with us for about four months. It has been a lot of learning journey for us because this product is made for the UAE, by the UAE and by the people of UAE. Every ingredient which has gone behind it is created with a lot of concept which goes behind it. Thank you.",

Thank you for providing this home material from UN to us and also thank you for the idea. Inside my mind and heart I had a thought one day we had to make something for Emirates. I came 1985 to this country so I need to do something before I leave this country that thought was there. The moment I met you through Prapati and the FNB team. I was so happy to get this idea on board with Barakkar. The raw material came to us so we started developing products. One we have already here which is Gaf Leaves now. We are going to blend this Gaf Leaves with banana and local dates and the camel milk and pure honey. The product is sugar free and product is having a lot of health benefits which you already did to your studies and home work. So we like to do this trial now to show you how we make the Gaf Smooth. So in order to develop any food product is required a lot of stuff starting from growing ingredients, availability, testing and studies and label regulations as well. So I was proud enough to have some mentors that can guide me through this journey to achieve all of these steps in order to launch the product. So I'm happy to know that this product will be launched soon in the market. I am happy to be selected as a part of the Innovation Lab and I would like to thank Halifa Fund, FNB Groups and Barakkar for making my dreams come true. Innovation for us is a way of life, one of the strongest pillar of what Barakkar stands for. This has been the second year Barakkar has been taking part in the Innovation Lab program. Thank you very much to the FNB team and the Khalifa Fund for giving us this opportunity. It's just not been a learning curve for us as manufacturers but a great opportunity for the young talents. Together with the young Emirates I think it's been a long journey from the starting stage to the boot camp program and the last but not the least the Dragon stand. This year there have been very innovative and a lot of challenging topics. There were a lot of people who had competent and taken up Barakkar's challenge. One of Barakkar's challenge was to create a product which was made from a superfood which contributes towards the health and wellness of people. What better challenge can we think of in today's world after the pandemic? We've had a lot of competitors taking up the challenge. It has been a great learning experience for us as well as for the students. The competition was not easy enough. It was a tough competition. At the end we've had two students who we had shortlisted, one for which we have been working very closely for an internship program. But together as a product which we got out from a very small budding stage into reality has been a new product which you will be seeing out soon. I wish good luck to Salma who has been working with us for about four months. It has been a lot of learning journey for us because this product is made for the UAE, by the UAE and by the people of UAE. Every ingredient which has gone behind it is created with a lot of concept which goes behind it. Thank you.",

    "full_text": " strong, precious Salzburg, FOR NOW!! For the Innovation Lab, basically this is the second year in a row that Emerson Macaroni participated with Challenges and we were as said previously very lucky that the previous year one of our candidates won the award. We hope for this year as well with the challenges that we chose and one of them is the waste management sustainability that the two teams that we have aspire and mastermind that one of them could actually pick up the prize and win. The challenge is really interesting it's a by-product it's basically using the waste coming out of the pasta, the regrinded pasta and transform them and mix them with other materials. One is to become as a product for animal feed and the other one is for fertilizer. Emerson Macaroni is happy to be part of the Innovation Lab which is supported by the FMB group and Khalifa fund and this is a major initiative to develop and drive the youth of the UAE to go into the food sector. The amount of seriousness to be quite honest how they took this challenge and you know not every idea or every challenge you start from the beginning and you just like reach till the end with the same direction there are some deviations that they've took in order to fix the challenge and get it towards the end. Actually Emerson Macaroni factory support started since the beginning and by the beginning I mean the idea brainstorming. We would come up and talk with Mr. Sammi about our ideas and what we are looking forward to do together and that went out to be where we are now. Coming to the new fishenotors was one of the main challenges we faced because we need to know what the product itself contains so though it took a lot of time but we were able to come up with the right information of what what all stuff the product contains and by knowing that we were able to incorporate the other essential nutrients to our feeder. Of course this could not have been easier or this could not have happened without the help of Emerson Macaroni factory thanks to the team who was always there in our back they had I can hold you and I'm there for you mentality where they served us. Hi my name is Mohamed Serlas Shrubf I'm a master student in food science from your university. I came to know about this FNB innovation program from our college from our professors and the University members. We joined the FNB innovation program to know about more about the challenges and the manufacturers. We were teamed up we met the other team members Karima Sheha and Ali from the Innovation Ideatone Week. From though we grew up together and we started doing the challenges together and finally we were able to be selected for the Emerson Macaroni Challenge. So right from the beginning when we came across the Emerson Macaroni Challenge we were interested to participate for that since they were dealing with the waste management and how they could solve their past service teaching their company. So we came up with suitable solution how we could come up with a new product which is sustainable and feasible. I'm Karima Fadi I'm a graduate student at your university I'm taking my masters in food science. I got to know about FNB through university thanks to my doctors and through there I only got to meet my team members and we got to have an aspire team. Personally my interest in waste management and sustainability as well as poultry of course has sparked the interest of Emirates Macaroni factory. Basically the idea of getting the waste past a meal and putting it in the feed production has been always an idea that triggered me and with this collaboration as well as my team having an interest in that we got to work and produce a new feed where it's sustainable. It's part of it is from food wastage as well as part of it has been locally produced since the pasta and Emirates Macaroni factory is locally produced.",
